Two drupal helper modules:

[user:password] token
----------------------
raveman_password module adds *[user:password]* token to user token dictionary. Now it is possible to send user password when creating new user in drupal 7.

Profile unlock
--------------
raveman_profile module unlocks legacy drupal *Profile* module, which is disabled by default. Profile module is useful, when you have to create additional user info while creating new user in drupal and send this info via email to user.
